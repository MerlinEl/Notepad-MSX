Warning
---------------------------
The MassFX authored in this file was created with a newer version of the plugins. Forward compatibility is not supported, so things might not behave properly.
---------------------------
OK   
---------------------------
The MassFX version warning is just caused by script which checks each Max file 
during load and looks for the MassFX properties in those files. 
If the version differs it triggers the warning. MassFX properties get saved with each file, 
even if you never used MassFX in them ...
IMHO not a very cleverly coded solution, but as long as you are not using MassFX 
in your scenes you simply can ignore those warnings. As Max does'nt crash right at load time 
when the warning appears, the crash is 100% not related to MassFX.
